## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Author Journey (Denise Rodriguez Dao):**
Denise needs a personal publication platform to write and share her stories about grief, migration, and art with a dedicated readership. She wants to compose stories with rich formatting, organize them by themes, publish them when ready, and manage reader engagement through comment moderation.

**Reader Journey:**
Readers discovering The Incurable Humanist want to explore Denise's stories about grief, migration, and art. They browse published content organized by themes, read stories that resonate with their experiences, leave thoughtful comments, bookmark favorites for later, and subscribe to email newsletters to receive new content and curated story collections.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Author (Denise) Scenarios:**
1. **Given** Denise has written a new story, **When** she accesses her author dashboard, **Then** she can compose, format, categorize, and publish the story

2. **Given** Denise has published stories, **When** she reviews reader engagement, **Then** she can see comment activity and moderate comments before they appear publicly

3. **Given** Denise wants to feature specific stories, **When** she curates content for the newsletter, **Then** she can select stories and schedule newsletter delivery to subscribers

4. **Given** Denise published a story with an error, **When** she edits the published story, **Then** changes are saved and reflected immediately without affecting reader bookmarks or comments

**Reader Scenarios:**
5. **Given** a visitor discovers the platform, **When** they browse the homepage, **Then** they see published stories organized by themes (grief, migration, art) without requiring authentication

6. **Given** a reader finds a meaningful story, **When** they want to engage, **Then** they can create an account, bookmark the story, and submit a comment for moderation

7. **Given** a reader wants regular updates, **When** they subscribe to the newsletter, **Then** they receive curated story collections and new content notifications based on their indicated interests

8. **Given** a subscribed reader receives a newsletter, **When** they click a story link, **Then** they land directly on the story with reading progress tracked (if authenticated)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Denise deletes a published story that readers have bookmarked and commented on? Story is archived (removed from public view) but data (bookmarks, comments) is preserved in the system.
- How does the system handle a reader attempting to submit a story (they should not have this capability)?
- What happens when Denise moderates comments‚Äîcan she reply to comments? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: author-reader dialogue capability?]
- How does the platform handle newsletter delivery failures or bounced emails?
- What happens when the same story fits multiple themes (grief + migration + art)? [Multi-categorization allowed]
- How does the system prevent unauthorized users from accessing the author dashboard?
