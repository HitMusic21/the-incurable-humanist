## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Community members‚Äîhighly educated, bicultural immigrants experiencing grief from death, migration, cultural dislocation, or trauma‚Äîneed a safe digital space to share personal stories about their experiences with grief, migration, and art. They want to read authentic narratives from others with similar experiences, connect through meaningful engagement (comments, discussions), and receive curated content that resonates with their cultural identity and emotional journey. The platform serves as a healing community where vulnerability is valued and storytelling becomes a collective act of resilience.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new visitor lands on the platform, **When** they browse story collections, **Then** they can read published stories organized by themes (grief, migration, art) without requiring authentication

2. **Given** a registered community member wants to share their story, **When** they submit a personal narrative with category tags and cultural identifiers, **Then** the system receives their submission for moderation review

3. **Given** an approved story is published, **When** community members read and engage with it, **Then** they can leave supportive comments, bookmark stories, and share them with attribution

4. **Given** a community member consents to analytics, **When** they interact with platform features, **Then** their engagement patterns inform personalized content recommendations while respecting privacy preferences

5. **Given** a user wants email updates, **When** they subscribe to the newsletter, **Then** they receive weekly curated story collections based on their indicated interests and cultural background

6. **Given** community members access the platform, **When** they browse or submit content, **Then** they interact with the platform in English

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a submitted story contains potentially triggering content without warnings? System queues story for human moderator review who can reject, request revisions with content warnings, or approve with added warnings before publication.
- How does the system handle stories that blur the line between appropriate vulnerability and content that requires professional mental health support?
- What happens when a user requests deletion of their published story that has active community engagement (comments, bookmarks)?
- How does the platform manage content from users in jurisdictions with different data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, others)?
- What happens when the same story fits multiple categories (grief + migration + art)?
